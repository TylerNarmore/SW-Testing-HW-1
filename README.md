## Introduction
The team built an application that runs four different functions to understand Test-Driven Development and Unit Testing. The Body Mass Index, Retirement, Distance Formula, and Email Verifer functions were throughly tested before the team wrote the code and the team learned much throughout the testing process. The Body Mass Index function calculates a user's BMI and displays their category. The Retirement function gives the user their age when they will meet their savings goal. The Distance Formula function calculates the distance between two points. The Email Verifier function determines if an email address is valid. All functions come with a respective test as well.
